## PROJECT SUMMARY

The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) significantly influences Earth’s climate, ecosystems, and human societies; Yet, forecasting ENSO at lead times of more than a year remains a challenge for the whole climate community. This project aims at developing a deep learning system by training a convolutional neural network to improve multi-year ENSO prediction, which will potentially supplement current dynamical forecast systems based on global climate models. 


## MPROJECT BACKGROUND 

ENSO is a dominant climate patterns involving changes of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific. The recurrence of warm and cold phases of ENSO, commonly referred to as El Niño and La Niña events, substantially impacts regional and global climate, water cycle, agriculture, and ecosystems. Climate scientists have started to utilize climate models to forecast ENSO since the 1980s. After decades of effort, current climate prediction systems (e.g., ensemble forecasting using coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and Phase 6; hereafter, CMIP5/6) can skillfully forecast ENSO with lead-times of 6-12 months. Long-lead prediction of ENSO nevertheless particularly with lead-times over one year remains problematic in practice.

## PROJECT MILESTONES

_May 2021_ - Project was initiated! 

_Jun. 2021_ - Project proposal finished and submitted! 

_July 2021_ - Finished data collection and preparation. Collected data included CMIP5/6 historical simulations and observational datasets for sea surface temperature and ocean heat content. 

*Coming soon...*
- Collect and annotate more data. 
- Start to develop and train a CNN model. 
- Try all kinds of things to optimize the deep learning model.
- Test the reliability of the deep learning ENSO prediction model. 
- More ideas later ...
