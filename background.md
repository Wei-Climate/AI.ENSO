### ENSO Dynamics 

## What is ENSO?

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an irregular periodic variation in winds and sea surface temperatures over the tropical eastern Pacific Ocean, affecting the climate of much of the tropics and subtropics. The warming phase of the sea temperature is known as El Niño and the cooling phase as La Niña. 





## ENSO prediction skills in current climate models 

Despite of advances in climate modeling, multi-year ENSO prediction remains a challenge. Uncertainty in model initialization, incomplete understanding and imperfect reproduction of the climate variability, as well as insufficient computational resources, limits the practical predictability of climate system. Research has suggested that ENSO can be skillfully predictable with lead times of 6-12 months. Multi-year ENSO prediction particularly with lead times over one year is problematic.
