### ENSO prediction skills in current climate models 

Despite of advances in climate modeling, multi-year ENSO prediction remains a challenge. Uncertainty in model initialization, incomplete understanding and imperfect reproduction of the climate variability, as well as insufficient computational resources, limits the practical predictability of climate system. Research has suggested that ENSO can be skillfully predictable with lead times of 6-12 months. Multi-year ENSO prediction particularly with lead times over one year is problematic.
