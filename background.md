### ENSO prediction skills in current climate models 

ENSO is a dominant climate patterns involving changes of sea surface temperature in the tropical Pacific. The recurrence of warm and cold phases of ENSO, commonly referred to as El Niño and La Niña events, substantially impacts regional and global climate, water cycle, agriculture, and ecosystems. Climate scientists have started to utilize climate models to forecast ENSO since the 1980s. After decades of effort, current climate prediction systems (e.g., ensemble forecasting using coupled models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 and Phase 6; hereafter, CMIP5/6) can skillfully forecast ENSO with lead-times of 6-12 months. Long-lead prediction of ENSO nevertheless particularly with lead-times over one year remains problematic in practice.
