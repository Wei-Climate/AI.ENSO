Develop a Deep Learning System for Multi-year ENSO prediction

Main Objective: 
Current dynamical climate model can make skillful ENSO forecasts at lead times of 6-12 months. Multi-year ENSO prediction remians problematic due to uncertainty in models and impefect understanding of dynamics. The project aims at developing a deep learning ENSO prediction system to improve ENSO prediction at lead times of 12-24 months.
